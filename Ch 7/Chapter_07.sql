    last_name text,
    salary numeric(10,2),
    dept_id integer REFERENCES departments (dept_id),

-- Listing 7-2: Joining the employees and departments tables

SELECT *
FROM employees JOIN departments

ORDER BY employees.dept_id;

-- Listing 7-3: Creating two tables to explore JOIN types

CREATE TABLE district_2020 (
    id integer CONSTRAINT id_key_2020 PRIMARY KEY,

-- Listing 7-4: Using JOIN

SELECT *

-- Listing 7-9: Using CROSS JOIN

SELECT *
FROM district_2020 CROSS JOIN district_2035
ORDER BY district_2020.id, district_2035.id;

-- Alternately, a CROSS JOIN can be written with a comma-join syntax:
SELECT *
FROM district_2020, district_2035
ORDER BY district_2020.id, district_2035.id;

-- Or it can be written as a JOIN with true in the ON clause:
SELECT *
FROM district_2020 JOIN district_2035 ON true
ORDER BY district_2020.id, district_2035.id;

-- Listing 7-10: Filtering to show missing values with IS NULL

SELECT *
FROM district_2020 LEFT JOIN district_2035
ON district_2020.id = district_2035.id
WHERE district_2035.id IS NULL;

-- alternately, with a RIGHT JOIN
SELECT *
FROM district_2020 RIGHT JOIN district_2035
ON district_2020.id = district_2035.id
WHERE district_2020.id IS NULL;
